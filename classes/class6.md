Branching:
Group A
Create a branch, add your files to it, push to git (+ add your names to the readme)
Group B
Pull github repo from group A, create a branch, add your files to it (+ add your names to the readme)



Group A & B:
on the github create a PR, with your own branch

Group A:
merge your changes to main/master

Group B:
merge your changes to main/master - solve potential merge conflicts together with group A. 


Optional: Apply the combined code to create a csv of the books
Optional: Using your csv fit a Linear model to predict the author/genre of the text. Note that you have too many predictors for linear regression using all the predictors so you will need to perform some for of selection.
