The Rains of Castamere is not only the best episode next to episode 4, but it's also intense and very satisfying. There's nothing I can fault this with because it's another classic that does exactly the same thing that the last two episodes of Season 1 and 2 did. The storyline/script is still well-written with more intensity and more satisfying drama, the performances are still compelling, the relationships are even more interesting than I thought, the pacing is superb, the directing is solid, the scenery is still gorgeous, Ramin Djawadi does a great job creating some intense moments in his score, the editing is still sharp, and the characters are even better as the plot progresses. So, overall, another classic episode and I'm finishing up Season 3.
