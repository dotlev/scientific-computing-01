Biggest disappointment and letdown in Television history Our biggest fear was confirmed. We got a weak and absurd final episode. We have gone from episodes like The Red Wedding and The Winds of Winter to this sorry excuse of an episode. I'm struggling to believe that they intentionally thought this was good writing, maybe I should give it a go. It seems many fans had better ideas on how/what should have happened. Maybe Hollywood will let me write bad scripts and get married to a pretty film star. The tragedy is that is such a sorry and weak way to wrap up such a show. This season was a disgrace to all that has come before it. The issues are through the roof.
